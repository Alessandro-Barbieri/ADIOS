1.4.1 Release Aug 2012
    - aggregated file reader method (from 1.3.1): 
      use ADIOS_READ_METHOD_BP_AGGREGATE
    - memory limitation specified by user for chunked reading 
      now taken into account in file reading
    - stage writer example code for staged I/O
      see examples/stage_write
    - code coupling example code for file-based/staged coupling
      see examples/coupling
    - bp2h5 supports converting complex and double complex types
    - fix: F90 modules: adios_write, adios_schedule_read
    - fix: invalid "out of bound" errors when reading multiple steps 
           of multi-dimensional arrays
    - fix: double-free bug in support of old read API in Fortran
    - fix: backward compatibility of old read API to read multi-group 
           files (fixed "invalid variable id..." errors)

1.4.0 Release July 2012
    - new read API for staging method with step-by-step processing, 
       also with non-blocking and chunking APIs
    - visualization schema added to ADIOS XML format
    - skel: I/O skeleton generator and evaluation tools
    - unified error/debug logging
    - attributes written from only 1 processor to save on metadata
    - ADIOS version identifier in ADIOS-BP format
    - extra hidden attributes (version, create/update times) 
    - Java and Python bindings
    - F90 modules adios_write_mod and adios_read_mod 
          to check syntax at compile time


1.3.1 Released Nov 2011
    - fix: non-compliant MPI collective calls
    - fix: MPI_AMR method caused MPI_Finalize issues on some clusters
    - fix: histogram calculation: freeing memory too early

1.3 Released July 12, 2011
    - New read method BP_STAGED for reading files with improved performance
    - Changes in MPI_AMR and MPI_LUSTRE to support default parameters. 
      Parameters for MPI_LUSTRE and MPI_AMR in XML file are not mandatory 
      any more.

1.2.1 Released Aug 25, 2010
    - Bug fix in read API (arrays written every timestep but without time 
      dimension caused aborts)
    - DIMES method from Rutgers

1.2 Released July 15, 2010
    - XML and non-XML write APIs are available
    - More statistics (min/max/avg/std.dev) available without
      overhead in write performance
    - Added MPI_AMR method for advanced mesh refinement codes and
      for aggregated writing (N procs to P writers to M disks)
    - Added support for subfiles
      - POSIX method many-file output can be read as one file
      - MPI_AMR method uses subfiles to improve write performance
    - Added NetCDF-4 transport method
    - Asynchronous, staging methods on Jaguar XT5 at ORNL
      - DataTap from Georgia Tech
      - DataSpaces from Rutgers
      - NSSI from Sandia
    - MPI_LUSTRE method for best performance on Lustre file system


1.0.1  Released on Dec 9, 2009
    - fix: builds read API on Mac (was broken at utils/bpdump)
    - fix: Fortran written BP files are correctly read by Fortran readers
    - added adios_mpi_stripe2 method for improved performance on Lustre 
      file system

1.0  Released on Nov 18, 2009
