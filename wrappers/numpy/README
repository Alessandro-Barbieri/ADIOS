ADIOS Python/Numpy wrapper
-----------------

This directory contains the codes for the ADIOS python/numpy wrapper
to call the native ADIOS library. This module is built by Cython.

== Build and install with make ==

A Makefile is included for building. The following commands will
display instructions on how to build and install python wrappers for
Adios.

$ make
$ make install

Have 'adios_config' and 'python' in the path and run

$ make python

If you need a MPI-enabled ADIOS wrapper, which requires MPI4Py, type
the following:

$ make MPI=y python

After successful building, you can install in a python path. There are
three options

$ python setup.py install

which will install python's default installation location. This may
require an admin privilege.

You may want to use a custom directory to install. Type

$ python setup.py install --prefix=/dir/to/install

and append the directory to the PYTHONPATH environment variable

You can also install in your local directory, run

$ python setup.py install --user

== Compile with Cython (only for developers) ==

The C++ code (adios.cpp and adios_mpi.cpp) has been already generated
by with Cython (version 0.20.1) and included here. Just in case to
reproduce the C++ code, try the following command. Otherwise, one can
skip this part.

$ make CYTHON=y python

for the serial version of Adios wrapper. If you need to generated C++
for MPI-enabled version, try the following

$ make CYTHON=y MPI=y python

== Note on compilers ==

In most cases, pre-installed python is built with gcc. Thus, before
build Adios python wrappers, you load a GNU programming
environment. For example, in Sith, type the following:

$ module load PE-gnu

In Titan, type:

$ module load PrgEnv-gnu
