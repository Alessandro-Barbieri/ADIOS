ADIOS Python/Numpy wrapper
-----------------

This directory contains the codes for the ADIOS python/numpy wrapper
to call the native ADIOS library. This module is built by Cython.

== Compile with Cython ==

The C++ code (adios.cpp) has been already compiled with Cython
(version 0.20.1) and included here. Just in case to reproduce the C++
code, try the following command. Otherwise, one can skip this part.

$ cython --cplus adios.pyx 

If you need a parallel adios wrapper, try:

$ cython --cplus adios_mpi.pyx 

== Build with Python == 

This program can be built and installed by using python's standard
package distribution method. For example,

$ python setup.py build
will compile adios python module. Once successfully completed, type

$ python setup.py install 
Or,
$ python setup.py install --user
to install ADIOS module in python's default package directory or user
local directory.

If you need a parallel adios wrapper, try:

$ python setup_mpi.py build
$ python setup_mpi.py install
Or,
$ python setup_mpi.py install --user
