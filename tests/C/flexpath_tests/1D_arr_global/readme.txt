DESCRIPTION
===========
This is a test case for Flexpath. The idea of the test: The writer writes a
1D array of NX double elements. The array is written as ADIOS global array
so each process writes in a global space, but in its own place.

The writer writes the 1D array and the reader reads the 1D array of doubles.

There might be as many writers as you wish, and there might be as many readers
as you wish. However, each rank reads its own rank. The reader knows how many 
writers were there so if its rank is higher then it quits.

The test can work with two modes:

1. MPI/ADIOS_READ_METHOD_BP
2. FLEXPATH/ADIOS_READ_METHOD_FLEXPATH

Unfortunately, to switch between those two modes, it is required to modify
the source files and recompile. To switch to FLEXPATH mode:

- uncomment FLEXPATH_METHOD macro in misc.h
- uncomment in arrays.xml 
    <method group="temperature"  method="FLEXPATH">QUEUE_SIZE=4;</method>
  and comment
    <!-- <method group="temperature"  method="MPI">QUEUE_SIZE=4;</method> -->
    
 In order to switch to the MPI mode:
 - comment FLEXPATH_METHOD macro in misc.h
 - comment in arrays.xml
    <method group="temperature"  method="FLEXPATH">QUEUE_SIZE=4;</method>
   and uncomment 
    <method group="temperature"  method="MPI">QUEUE_SIZE=4;</method>

BUILD
=======
$ make

# should remove all unnecessary exec files 
$ make clean

RUN
=====
# should remove text file remnants from Flexpath _read_ready.txt, _info_writer.txt
$ make clean_test

$ mpirun -np 2 ./writer
$ mpirun -np 2 ./reader

See Makefile for other options or add '-h' option to the reader or writer

NOTES
=======

2013-07-15 - tested on my local laptop (MPI and FLEXPATH)


OUTDATED (2013-07-08)
======================
I will update later. 

RUNNING ON KRAKEN
=================
This runs one reader per node and one writer per node.

aprun -n 1 -N 1 ./arrays_read &
aprun -n 1 -N 1 ./arrays_write

You should be able to run the example with as many readers and writers as you wish.

Example PBS script
------------------
#!/bash/bin
#PBS -l walltime=00:05:00,size=24
#PBS -A UT-TENN0033

date

echo "nodefile="
cat $PBS_NODEFILE
echo "=end nodefile"

# make sure you have all modules loaded
module use ~smagg/opt/modulefiles
module load mag-mxml-2.7/kraken-gnu
module list

cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR

aprun -n 1 -N 1 ./arrays_read &
aprun -n 1 -N 1 ./arrays_write

date

# eof


TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

There might be text files left; they should be removed for the next run.

# EOF
