Coupling scenarios
==================

1. coupling2D.xml
   coupling_writer_2D.F90 and coupling_reader_2D.F90

   Writer has a 2D array with 2D (block,block) decomposition.
   It writes into writer_<timestep>.bp

   Reader's each process reads in the whole 2D array.
   One of the processes writes the whole array into reader_<timestep>.bp

   Check: writer_<ts>.bp/var/xy should be the same as reader_<ts>/var/xy
        $ bpls -d writer_3.bp var/xy  | grep -v double > w
        $ bpls -d reader_3.bp var/xy  | grep -v double > r
        $ diff -s w r
        Files w and r are identical

2. coupling_writer_2D_dart.F90 and coupling_reader_2D_dart.F90
   Scenario 1 using DART for memory-to-memory coupling
   (no writer_*.bp anymore).
   Still needs adios and coupling2D.xml for the reader to write
   reader_*.bp
