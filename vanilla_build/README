This directory is for building a sequential libadios.a and libadiosf.a, without MPI, without MPI-based methods, without external libraries (except for mxml).

Required:
    C compiler
    Fortran 90 compiler
    MXML 2.7

It builds:
    libadios.a   (for C applications)
    libadiosf.a  (for Fortran applications)
    bpls and bpdump tools to examine ADIOS output files
    write_read test code to check if the library works correctly

Use 'make help' to print 
  - the flags used to build this libary
  - the build steps
  - the flags for building an application after installing this library.

Create a 'make.settings.<host>' file, where <host> is any string, which defines the build flags and the mxml dependency.  Then call 'make HOST=<host>' to build for your system, or edit the HOST variable in the Makefile.


To remove all generated files, run 'make clean'.
