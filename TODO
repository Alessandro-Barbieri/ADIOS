WRITE
=====

- bring back "write=no" into XML tag to skip some variables
- time-reset function for appending data to the same timestep ("extend" mode)
- complete error logging

READ
====
- chunking: 
  - support memory limit

- scalar written over timesteps (need to support old-fashioned way,
i.e., scalar dimension is tagged with "time-index".)

- missing data blocks when read should contain undef values

- simple BP reader
    - PG block selection read
    - auto selection read

- DataSpaces staging method
    - per block variable information
    - statistics
    - auto selection should do domain decomposition, not just return the 
      whole dataset per process

TEST
=====
The statistics of scalars written over multiple timestep. Particularly we 
need to test adios_complex and adios_double_complex scalars.

BUILD
=====
- shared libraries 
- cross-compile support
- separate source from build 
- add version defines into adios public header 

MANUAL
=====
- developer's manual
