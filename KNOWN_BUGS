Writing data
============

1. If the size specified to the adios_group_size is too small, the output
will be silently corrupt. Work around: make the size bigger. An error
message will be added in later releases.

2. If attempting to write >= 2GB from a single process, only some of the
methods correctly handle these large writes. 
If it fails, change to open/write/close to the file multiple times using
an append for the subsequent iterations to get all of the data written. 
The corrected code will be incorporated in all transport methods shortly.

Reading data
============

1. The read API defines void *mins and void *maxs returned by the adios_inq_var() funtion to contain the min/max of an array per timestep. In the current release these pointers are NULL always. 
Only the gmin and gmax single values as global min/max of an array over all timesteps are available.
