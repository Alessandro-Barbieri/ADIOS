============

- Statistics: scalars over time have no statistics calculated when queried with adios_inq_var_stat(). Only the value written by rank 0 at the first step is seen. 
Work around: adios_inq_var_stat() returns per-step statistics too, and at each step min/max equals the value at that step, so one can calculate a global min/max over time from this list.
