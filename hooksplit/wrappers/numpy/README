ADIOS Python/Numpy wrapper
-----------------

This directory contains the codes for the ADIOS python/numpy wrapper
to to call the native ADIOS library. This module is built by Cython.


== Build == 

This program can be built with CMake (http://www.cmake.org/). You may
want to a build directory and run cmake pointing the source directory
containing CMakeLists.txt (this directory). For example, 

$ mkdir build; cd build
$ cmake /dir/to/source

CMake will search installed ADIOS library and Python/Numpy. Once
completed, type make to build:

$ make
Or, 
$ make VERBOSE=1
if you need verbose output.

After successful building, you can see adios.so. This file can be
loaded in Python.

== Test == 

This program contains a test program. To run testing after building,
type the following command:

$ make test

If you need a verbose output, type the following

$ ctest -V
