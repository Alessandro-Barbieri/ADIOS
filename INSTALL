Installation Instructions for ADIOS Software
==================================================

This file provides instructions for installing the ADIOS software.
If you have any problems with the installation, please see the 
ADIOS support page at the following location:

    http://www.nccs.gov/user-support/adios

Obtaining ADIOS
===============

    You can download the latest ADIOS source package from the ADIOS 
    home page.

Requirements and optional features
==================================

 - ADIOS requires MPI and MPI-IO. 

 - ADIOS requires a version 2.5 or higher of Mini-XML.
   The Mini-XML library is used to parse XML configuration files. 
   It can be downloaded from 
      http://www.minixml.org/software.php

 - A Fortran 90 compiler is optional.
   The Fortran API is built only if a Fortran 90 compiler is available.
   Use --disable-fortran at configuration time to disable this feature. 

 - NetCDF-3 is optional.
   The bp2ncd converter utility to NetCDF format is built only if NetCDF
   is available. Currently ADIOS uses the NetCDF-3 library. Use the option
   --with netcdf=<path> or ensure that the NETCDF_DIR environment variable 
   is set before configuring ADIOS.

 - HDF5 is optional.
   The bp2h5 converter utility to HDF5 format is built only if a HDF5 
   library is available. Currently ADIOS uses the 1.6 version of the HDF5 
   API but it can be built and used with the 1.8.x version of the HDF5 
   library too. Use the option --with hdf5=<path> or ensure that the HDF5_DIR 
   environment variable is set before configuring ADIOS.

 - Parallel HDF5 is optional.
   The transport method writing files in the Parallel HDF5 format is built
   only if a parallel version of the HDF5 library is (also) available. 
   If the HDF5_DIR environment variable points to a parallel HDF5 
   installation configure will use it, otherwise you need to use the option
   --with phdf5=<path> to build this transport method. 
   Note that if you build this transport method, ADIOS will depend on
   PHDF5 when you link any application with ADIOS even if the 
   application does not intend to use this method.

 - Matlab is optional
   If you have Matlab, you can build the ADIOS reader for Matlab separatly
   after building ADIOS. See details below in the Matlab section but before
   configuring ADIOS.


Quick Installation
==================

   The following steps are needed to configure, build and install ADIOS.
   For example, to install ADIOS to /usr/local/adios on a machine where
   mpicc and mpif90 are the compilers:

   $ tar zxf adios-1.0.tar.gz
   $ cd adios-1.0
   $ CC=mpicc FC=mpif90 ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/adios 
       --with-mxml=<location of mini-xml installation>
       --with-hdf5=<location of HDF5 installation>
       --with-netcdf=<location of netCDF installation>
   $ make
   $ make install


Full installation instructions
==============================

Architectures and compilers
---------------------------

   Cray XT machines
   ----------------
   Use "CC=cc FC=ftn" for the configure command. 
   These wrappers should be using the actual C and Fortran compilers on 
   such machines. ADIOS can be compiled with GNU, PGI and Intel compilers
   but it does not compile with the Cray compiler. If you are using the
   Cray compilers to build your application build the ADIOS library with 
   the GNU compiler.

   BlueGene machines
   -----------------
   Use the following compiler settings for the configure command:
     MPICC=mpixlc_r MPIFC=mpixlf90_r CC=xlc_r FC=xlf90_r

   Mac OSX
   -------
   On Mac OSX, only the Read API and the utilities can be built. 
   Use the --disable-write option for the configure command. 

   Linux
   -----
   ADIOS should configure and build fine on Linux. One possible issue
   is that configure may break in one of the tests for the fortran compiler
   test with mpif90. If you have set FC=mpif90 before configure, try to 
   configure without setting it. Then configure will test the default
   f90 compiler (gfortran most likely) and pass but still will use mpif90 to 
   build ADIOS.

Configuring
-----------
   Hint: look at the runconf script in the distribution directory. This 
   script is used to configure ADIOS on our systems. It may help you 
   in configuring ADIOS for your system. 

   ./configure --help 
   lists the options that you can use. 

Matlab
------
   Matlab MEX compiler uses GNU gcc to compile codes so you need to build
   ADIOS with gcc. It also requires relocatable code, therefore you need to
   specify -fPIC in your C compiler flags when configuring ADIOS:

   $ CFLAGS="-fPIC" ./configure
   $ make

   After building ADIOS, you can build the reader for Matlab. Ensure that 
   the MEX compiler 'mex' is in the path:

   $ cd tools/matlab
   $ make matlab

   You need to install the ADIOS M and MEX files in tools/matlab manually
   to a directory where Matlab can find them (you can tell Matlab where to 
   look for them by setting the MATLABPATH environment variable).
    
HDF5
----
   If you have parallel HDF5 installed and HDF5_DIR is set to this library,
   configure will find it and use it for both HDF5 and PHDF5. This may or 
   may not work to build utils/bp2h5. If not, you need to use a non-parallel
   version of HDF5 to build bp2h5. Use the --with-hdf5 option to tell 
   configure where to look for the non-parallel HDF5 library. Or you can
   skip building it with --without-hdf5 option. The PHDF5 method for ADIOS 
   will still be built.
