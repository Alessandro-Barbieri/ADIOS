>      Let me explain a little more the attachments I sent you the other

> 
>      (1) Interface
>      (2) MGFLD
>      (3) EOS
>      (4) Data
> 
>      The subroutines in the interface attachment are the ones that you 
> need to call in order to merge MGFLD with Zeus. The calls are 
explained

> 
>      THE MGFLD subroutines are contained in the attachment MGFLD 
(oddly 
> enough). These need to be compiled, but should otherwise be invisible. 
> These subroutines are called by the subroutines in the "Interface" 
> package.
> 
>      The "EOS" package contains the EOS that is MGFLD needs to call in 
> order to get mass fractions, chemical potentials, etc. This oackage 
> will be obviated once I can get Doug's tabular EOS to work and I can 
> write a simple interface for it.
> 
>      The "Data" package contains the data that the EOS subroutines 
> need, some of the scattering sybroutines need, and the various keys 
> that are read when MGFLD is initialized. The data files are fairly 
> minimal as dar as storage is concerned. What I need to know is where 
> you want to locate these data files relative to the MGFLD subroutines 
> so I can provide a link between the two in the various call 
statements. 
> I will also send you several more versions of these data files with 
> different keys for MGFLD so the latter can be run, for example, with 
> only emission and absorption turned on This will allow it to fire-up 
> very quickly and therefore be a useful mode for testing.
