Introduction}\rm  This document is designed to serve as a users guide to the EOS codeof Lattimer and Swesty \cite{ls}, \cite{llpr}.  Both the formulation of the EOS andthe code itself were designed specifically to be used in radiation hydrodynamic simulations.  The code and the associated common blocksare rather lengthy, and I would recommend against making any changesto it, since you may run  into problems.  If you have to make changes toget the code to run on your machine, please proceed cautiously.The EOS code is divided into several main parts.  There are two mainsub-EOS's: the nuclear EOS (where nuclei exist) and the bulk EOS wherethere are only alpha particles and exterior nucleons.  There is amodule that combines these two EOS's in the Maxwell construction regime.And finally, there is a logic module that determines which EOS to use.These things are all transparent to the user, but I will refer to themin the following sections.\vskip 0.3in\bf\centerline{2. Caveats}\rm  The code presently has a few limitations in what in can do.  First and foremost it is not idiot proof.  If you give it garbage inputsit will undoubtedly crash or at least give you garbage back.  Ihave not put any checks in to make sure the inputs are reasonablesince this would merely cost more CPU time.  The responsibilityfor making sure the inputs are reasonable is yours.  Secondly, all inputs are in nuclear units, i.e., Mev \& fermis.  For specificinformation on individual variables see Section 6 of these notes.  The EOS code currently is restricted to the following rangesof temperature, density and Ye: $T>0.05$ MeV, $n > 10^{-8}$ per cubic fermi,and $ 0.55> Y_e > 0.03$.  There is the slight possibility that you may havea few problems with the EOS when you are in a situation with low temperaturesand low $Y_e$'s (i.e. in $\beta$ equilibrium at low $T$).  We thereforerecommend at present that all $\beta$ equilibrium calculations be done attemperatures of greater than 0.5 MeV.  We hope to remove even this constraintfrom the EOS code in the near future.  Lastly, remember that this EOS assumes the condition of nuclear statisticalequilibrium.  If you try to apply this EOS to a non-NSE situation you may run into problems.  Specifically, I am thinking of the situation where you maystart with a precollapse core containing the silicon shell as well as the iron.If youstart with such an initial configuration that was computed with a network, and you use the density, electron fraction, and temperature or internalenergy as inputs to our EOS the pressures will have an excess or deficitwith respect to those computed with the network.  Typically, I have foundthese differences to be small enough that I can live with them.Alternatively, you can adjust the initial temperature or internal energyso that the two pressures match, or visa versa.\vskip 0.3in\bf\centerline{3. Initializing the EOS}\rm  In order to use the EOS a call must be made to the initialization routinethat loads all the tables the EOS needs.  This call should only be made oncebefore you call the EOS for the first time.  The call will simply be:\centerline{ CALL LOADMX() }  This routine requires that the file ``fermi.atb'' be present in the workingdirectory.  DO NOT TAMPER THIS FILE.This file contains the cubic spline fit coefficients for the Fermiintegrals and will be read in automatically by the initialization routine.Additionally, at run time the user will be prompted for two other filescontaining the phase and Maxwell construction boundaries that must be supplied.These file are discussed in the following section.\vskip 0.3in\bf\centerline{4. Boundary and Maxwell Construction Files}\rm  The call to the LOADMX routine will cause the user to be prompted forfiles containing the loci of the phase and Maxwell construction boundaries(for further discussion see our preprint).  These files come in pairs; one pairfor each set of nuclear force parameters.  As with the fermi.atb file, there isno reason that you should alter these files.  At present we have sets of filesfor three different compressibilities:  $K = 180,220,$ and $375$ MeV.  Thesefiles are appropriately named bdXXX.atb and maxXXX.atb where XXX is 180, 220,or 375.  The bdXXX.atb file contains the phase boundary loci, and maxXXX.atbcontains the Maxwell construction loci.  The initialization routine is smart enough that it will not let you use a phase boundary and a Maxwell construction boundary that were computed withdifferent sets of nuclear force parameters.  The code that actually produces the boundary and Maxwell construction tablesis kind of finicky in that it needs fairly accurate initial guesses to getstarted, and it is not very user friendly.  For this reason I am not circulating it at present.  If you want tables foralternate parameter sets just let me know, and I'll crank them out (pleasedon't ask for tables for fifty different parameter sets; each settakes me about 8 hours of CPU time to build on a fast RISC architecture machine).  In the future I plan on crankingout a bunch of tables for various parameter sets, and I will let you knowwhen I have them.\vskip 0.3in\bf\centerline{5. Calling the EOS}\rm  The call to the EOS in your FORTRAN code should look like: \\\vskip 0.2in CALL INVEOS(INPVAR,TOLD,YE,BRYDNS,IFLAG,EOSFLG,FORFLG,SF,XPREV,PPREV) \\\vskip 0.2inThe parameters are as follows:\begin{itemize}\item INPVAR ({\bf Declared: DOUBLE PRECISION INPVAR(4)}) contains the inputvalues for the EOS.  INPVAR(1) is either the temperature, the entropy perbaryon, or the internal energy per baryon (IFLAG must be set to indicatewhich of these quantities you are using).  If you are inputting the temperatureor the internal energy per baryon, it must be in units of MeV.  If you are inputting the entropy per baryon, it must be in units of Boltzmannsconstant.INPVAR(2), INPVAR(3), and INPVAR(4) are initial guesses at the solution of theequilibrium equations.INPVAR(2) is the number density of nucleons in nuclei (in unitsof fm$^{-3}$).  Typically a good initial guess for this is $n_i \sim 0.155$.INPVAR(3) is $\eta_{po}$.  A good initial guess for this is $\eta_{po} = -15$.Similarly, INPVAR(4) is $\eta_{no}$, and a good initial guess for this is$\eta_{no} = -10$.  INPVAR(2), INPVAR(3), and INPVAR(4) return the truevalues of these variables after solving the equilibrium equations, so it isa good idea to save these for each zone where the EOS is called to use as initial guesses on the next call.  Using the previous values allows a muchfaster solution to the equilibrium equations then would otherwise be possible.\item TOLD ({\bf Declared: DOUBLE PRECISION TOLD}) This is the initial guess atthe temperature in units of MeV.  This variable is only used by the EOS ifyou are inputting internal energy per baryon or entropy per baryon viaINPVAR(1).  In those cases, the true value of the temperature is returnedby the EOS in TOLD.  Again, it is a good idea to save this for use as aninitial guess on the next call.  In the case where you are inputting the temperature via INPVAR(1) you may just ignore this variable altogether.\item YE({\bf Declared: DOUBLE PRECISION YE}) This is the net electron fractionwhich the EOS needs.\item BRYDNS ({\bf Declared: DOUBLE PRECISION BRYDNS}) This is the baryon numberdensity which you must supply in units of per cubic fermi.\item IFLAG ({\bf Declared: INTEGER IFLAG}) This variable tells the EOS whether youare inputting temperature, internal energy per baryon, or entropy per baryon.Set IFLAG to 1 to indicate temperature, 2 to indicate internal energy per baryon, and 3 to indicate entropy per baryon.\item EOSFLG ({\bf Declared: INTEGER EOSFLG}) This variable returns a value whichtells you what region of the temperature--density plane you are in.  A valueof 2 indicates the nuclear EOS was used.  A value of 3 indicates the Bulk EOS(no nuclei) was used.  A value of 4 indicates that you are in the Maxwell construction region.  It is not necessary to set this variable prior to thecall UNLESS you specifically want to force INVEOS to use a specific EOS(see FORFLG).  I would highly recommend against this as you may be trying to usea specific EOS in a region where the equilibrium equations have no solution.  Otherwise, the EOS has alogic module to determine what region of the temperature density plane it is inand it automatically sets EOSFLG accordingly.\item FORFLG ({\bf Declared: INTEGER FORFLG}) This is the forcing flag.  If FORFLGis set to zero, the code automatically figures out which region of the temperature-density plane it is in, and sets EOSFLG accordingly.  If FORFLGis set to 1, the code uses the EOS that you indicate by setting EOSFLG priorto the call to INVEOS.  I would recommend against using the latter option, as it was intended for my own debugging purposes.\item SF ({\bf Declared: INTEGER SF})  This variable is the success flag.A returned value of 1 indicates a successful EOS call; anything elseindicates a failure of some sort.  In the case of a failure, the bulk EOS iscalled and the thermodynamic variables from it are returned (this is an artifice designed to keep the calling code from crashing).  If you are goingto have trouble with the EOS, a tripped success flag will almost certainly be the first indicator.  Thus I would recommend always checkingthis flag after each call.\item XPREV ({\bf Declared: DOUBLE PRECISION XPREV})  Ignore this variable by simplysticking in a dummy variable in the call.  It is used for my own debuggingpurposes.\item PPREV ({\bf Declared: DOUBLE PRECISION PPREV}) This variable holds theinitial guess at the exterior proton fraction and is required by INVEOS.When there are no nuclei present this is the variable iterated on to solvethe equilibrium equations.  A good initial guess is YE*BRYDNS.  The truevalue is returned by INVEOS, and it would be a good idea to save this for thenext call.\end{itemize}  All the EOS variables that you may want for your own purposes (pressures,entropies, chemical potentials, etc.) are passed back to the calling code viacommon blocks.  This is described in the next section.\vskip 0.3in\bf\centerline{6. Accessing the EOS variables}\rm  All the information you will probably want and much more is passed back tothe calling routines through the common blocks in the INCLUDE file``eos\_m4a.inc''.  I would recommend using this include file in your codeas opposed to coding in the common blocks by hand.  If I happen to changethe structure of the common blocks in the future, this will let youavoid unnecessary changes to your code.  If you find that my variabledefinitions conflict with yours I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND WRITING A LITTLE``WRAPPER'' SUBROUTINE THAT CONVERTS MY VARIABLES TO YOURS AS OPPOSED TO CHANGING MY VARIABLE NAMES OR COMMON BLOCKS (DOING SO COULD QUICKLY GET YOU INTO AN UNBELIEVABLE MESS).  The ``wrapper'' routine canthen be called directly from your code.  The common blocks and their variables are described below.  NOTE THAT THERE ISNO IMPLICIT TYPING SCHEME PRESENT IN MY CODE!!!!  DON'T ASSUME THAT A VARIABLE ISINTEGER OR DOUBLE PRECISION BECAUSE OF ITS SPELLING!!!  CHECK THE INCLUDE FILETO MAKE SURE.  ALSO, NOTE THAT EVERY FLOATING POINT VARIABLE IN THE CODE ISDOUBLE PRECISION; THERE ARE NO ``REAL'' VARIABLES.  Basically, everything you want will be in the following three common blocks.The other common blocks largely contain EOS internals that will be of no use toyou in your codes.  If there is a quantity you need and it is not listed herelet me know and if it is not in one of the other common blocks already, I willput it in.\centerline{ Common block /EOSVAR/ }\begin{itemize}\item MUN.

How to change the Electron EOS to your favorite version}\rm  Changing the electron EOS to your personal favorite is relatively easy to do.Simply remove the {\bf EL\_EOS} subroutine from the {\bf eos.f} file and replace it with your own, keeping the call statement the same.  This should beeasy since the only inputs needed are $T$, $Y_e$, and $n$.  Next ALL the variables in the common block {\bf \/ELECTR\/} need to be set in your newelectron EOS; especially the derivatives.  Don't forget to include the photonsalso (barring plasma effects, this is only a few lines of code that you can steal from my routine).Lastly, make sure that your electron EOS is thermodynamically consistent.  Theoverall EOS won't be thermodynamically consistent if your electron EOS isn't.Don't throw my electron EOS away however as you will want to put it back infor debugging purposes if you run into a problem.\vskip 0.3in\bf\centerline{8. Tips for users}\rm  This section will gradually expand as time goes on.  For now I want to offera few important tips.  First, save the returned values (INPVAR(2:4),TOLD,PPREV) from the EOS to use on the next call IN THE SAME ZONE.  These values will allowallow the Newton-Raphson to start off practically right on top of thesolution and thus will allow it to converge faster.  This will be a majorsavings in CPU time right off the bat.  Secondly, in hydrocodes, whenupdating the internal energy via the first law, iterate on the temperatureas opposed to the internal energy (see the discussion section of our preprint).The EOS runs at least an order of magnitude faster when you give it the temperature as an input as opposed to the internal energy or entropy.Third, use the derivatives that the EOS returns instead of calling theEOS multiple times to take numerical derivatives.  The derivatives the EOSreturns are very accurate (far more so than numerical derivatives) and thiscombined with the fact of only having to make a single EOS call representsa significant savings of time.Lastly, when crossing some of the phase boundaries, the derivatives ofthermodynamic variables can change abruptly (this is a real effect nota numerical problem) so beware!  Such discontinuities can throw a seriousmonkey-wrench into Newton-Raphson schemes.  In these cases (like solving thefirst law when crossing the Maxwell construction region at high temperatures)I have always be able to remedy the situation by dropping into a bisectionscheme when the Newton-Raphson fails.  One more note for CRAY users.  If you have looked at my code by now you haveno doubt noticed it is double precision.  Rather than screw around changingit to single precision for the CRAY, I simply use the ``-dp'' option toCF77 when compiling.  This automatically compiles the code as singleprecision and makes all the appropriate changes in intrinsic functions etc.I have this code running on the YMP 8-32 at the PittsburghSupercomputing Center in such a fashion and it seems to work fine.\vskip 0.3in\bf\centerline{9. Reporting suspected problems}\rm  Caveat emptor. Undoubtedly, someone will find a bug or two in this code.  Hopefully, they will be very minor ones.  I am fairlysure I have beaten all the major bugs (the ones the have drastic effects onradiation hydrocodes) out of this code.  However I will not stake my life on this. I have had this code running successfully on various VAX\/VMS machines, DEC ULTRIX machines, and on a CRAY YMP under UNICOS.  Certainly, if you find a bug let me know at the address on the front pageor via internet: fswesty@sbast5.ess.sunysb.edu or bitnet: swesty@sunysbnp.I will get on it ASAP, PROVIDED that you do not alter my code anymore thanminimally necessary to get it to compile on your machine.  If you find what you think is a bug there are a number of things I ask youto do.  First, if you have your own electron EOS in the code, put mine back inand try it to see if you still get the bug.  Also, write down ALL the inputsto the INVEOS code at the point it is failing to as many significant digits as your machine allows.  Then write a little dozen line driver program to trythe EOS at this point specifically.  If the code doesn't fail then chances areyour code is causing the problem by writing out-of-bounds to an array oryou have an equivalence statement screwed up, etc.  Also, check to make surethat you have all the variables in the INVEOS call statement properlydeclared as INTEGER and DOUBLE PRECISION.  If the code still failswith a separate driving program calling it, then try turning off all theoptimization passes in the compiler and turning on bounds and overflowchecking where possible.  Especially if you are running on a UNIXmachine where the f77 compilers are notoriously bad.  I have found a number of bugs in various UNIX compilers and recentlyI found one caused by the optimizer. AFTER you have gone through all ofthese steps (the object being to narrow down the place where the bug occurs) and haven't found the solution to the problem contact me.If possible, try the little driver program on anothermachine running a different operating system (or at least onerunning a different version of FORTRAN).  This will tell us if the problem is machine specific.  When you contact me, give me the all inputs to INVEOS to asmany significant digits as possible, as well as every thing (error messages, etc.) that you know about the problem.  I will get back to you as soon as I can.  Also, be forwarned that my code sometimes spits out error messages that lookfairly serious (I think I have removed all the obscene ones) but don'tpanic.  It is quite possible that these won't even apply to your use of the code.  At any rate let me know if you encounter anything you are in doubt about.  Lastly, I would like to apologize in advance for any problems that you mayencounter with this EOS. I will try to track down any problems as fast as I can, but Iwould appreciate your patience in this matter as software support is notwhat I am tasked with in life.%---------------------------------------------------------------------------%                 References%---------------------------------------------------------------------------%%\pagebreak\noindent\baselineskip=20pt\bf\centerline {References}\normalsize\rm\begin{thebibliography}{MM}\bibitem[1] {ls} Lattimer, James M. and Swesty, F.
