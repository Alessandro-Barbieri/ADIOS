GTC/ADIOS Code and Benchmark

Enter the src directory and type 'make' to build. It will build two 
executables: gtc and gtc_posix. gtc uses ADIOS_MPI and ADIOS_MPI_CIO
methods and gtc_posix uses ADIOS_POSIX method. 

The code and config.xml are compatible with the latest ADIOS code.

The gtc.input file is an example input file for 512 cores with 
OpenMP threads set to 4. 

Benchmark scripts and input files will be added soon.
