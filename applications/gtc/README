GTC/ADIOS Code and Benchmark

Quick Start:
1. check out setup_gtc.sh script and run it with parameter set to
   the direcotry in which the benchmark environment is build.
   
For example:
> cp /ccs/home/zf2/ADIOS/trunk/applications/gtc/setup_gtc.sh .
> ./setup_gtc.sh /tmp/work/zf2/gtc_bench

Then the script will check out GTC source code, scripts and input
files from SVN and build the executables and benchmakr environment
under the directory /tmp/work/zf2/gtc_bench.

It will build two executables: gtc and gtc_posix. gtc uses 
ADIOS_MPI and ADIOS_MPI_CIO methods and gtc_posix uses ADIOS_POSIX 
method.

The code and config.xml are compatible with the latest ADIOS code.

The gtc_setting directory contains input parameter files (in P2,
P4, P8, P16 sub-directories). Inputs files in the same sub-directory
do weakly scaling. Input files in different Px directories use 
different mpsi values to do strong scaling. For example, using input 
files in P4 will generate files whose size is double of files using
inputs in P2.  

2. gtc_setting/gen_script.sh is used to generate PBS script according
   to the template gtc_setting/gtc.pbs.

Th usage of gen_script.sh is:

> ./gen_script.sh P2 512 MPI 1

This will generate a PBS script named as 'P2_512_MPI_1.pbs'. The job
created with this script will run in gtc_run/P2/512/MPI/1 and the 
timing results will be in gtc_results/P2/512/MPI/1.

Each ADIOS group has a corresponding timing file named as 
'group_name.prof'.

3. gtc_setting/post_script.sh is used for merging and sorting timing 
   results.

> ./post_script.sh P2 512 MPI

Details about benchmark scripts and input files will be added soon.
