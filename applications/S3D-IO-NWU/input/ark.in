Notes About Settings
--------------------
 1. AKR scheme should be set to 641.
 2. ARK should not be run with controller off, so keep cont_switch=1!
 3. Initial timestep should be set 10 to 100 smaller than the anticipated CFL limit.
 4. Minimum timestep should be used with CAUTION! It should be set at least 100 times
    less than the anticipated CFL limit.
 5. Relative Runge-Kutta error tolerance should be set between 1.0e-3 and 1.0e-4.
 6. Absolute Runge-Kutta error tolerance should be set between 1.0e-6 and 1.0e-7.
 7. ARK implicit iteration tolerance should be set to 100 times less than rk_rtol.
 8. Controller saftey factor should be set between 0.8 and 0.9.
 9. Controller gains should be set to 0.2, 0.2, 0.05, and 0.0, respectively.
10. Overall maximum change in timestep should be set between 3.0 and 5.0.
11. Minimum number of iterations should be set to at least 4. Increase for "cleaner"
    integration with fewer redo steps.
12. Maximum number of iterations should be approximately 5 more than the minimum number
    of iterations.
13. Maximum number of redo steps should be set around 500 or so. If redo steps occur
    often, then it is an indication that something is wrong.
14. Jacobian update should be set between 1 and 3 (typically 1). For really stiff
    problems, increase above 1 (but you will pay for it in cpu time!!!).
15. The method of evaluating this Jacobian should be using Adifor whenever possible.
    This is the fastest evaluation. Otherwise, use the numerical evaluation.
16. If using the numerical evaluation for the Jacobian, the order of accuracy should
    always be set to 2 (second-order). If, for whatever reason, one thinks more accuracy
    is needed, then set the order higher (fourth or sixth). (Most codes in the world
    typically only use first order.) The lower the order, the faster the evaluation.
17. If using the numerical evaluation for the Jacobian, the perturbation factor should
    be somewhere between 1.0e-6 and 1.0e-3. Lower values may be necessary at times.


Other Notes
-----------
 1. ARK works best with ample spatial resolution!!!
