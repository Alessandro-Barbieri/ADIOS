H2                fuel name
1.0               equivalence ratio
1.0               pressure in atm
2000.0            maximum temperature in K (overall for zero-dimensions)
300.0             minumum temperature in K (multi-dimensions only)
0.1               variance for temperature gaussians (multi-dimensions only)
0.333             shift factor for temperature gaussian (multi-dimensions only)




Notes:

1. The variance is scaled with a characteristic (longest) length in the domain.
   This results in a fixed ratio bewteen the width of the gaussian profile and
   the size of the domain.
2. The shift factor is the fractional location of the peak gaussian in the domain.
   The value should always be 0 < shift factor < 1.0. A value of 0.5 will place the
   peak in the center of the domain. The fractional location is the same for all
   coordinate directions in multi-dimensions.
